# ProbeDataTools
Python code for dealing with probe data.

Contains: 

**(1) ProbeData.py** which contains the probe data class. This is used to relate mineral data to useful information about their consitutent oxides.

**(2) CalcCationsMin.py** which contains a group of functions used to calculate the cations per formula unit of any mineral, given an ideal number of cations and anions per formula unit.
It also contains functions for filtering out non-ideal analyses.

**(3) CalcCationsMinFe3.py** (IN PROGRESS) which contains relevant functions to calculate the Fe2/3 ratio of a mineral via various stochiometric methods.

**(4) Test.py** which contains some example datasets and calculations.
